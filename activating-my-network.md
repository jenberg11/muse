Hi David,

After the adventures of the last few years at SAP Concur I am sensing it is time for the next step in my professional pursuits and new challenges. I am activating my network to find the next great role and I am hoping to get your help!

Along with my resume at https://retrosight.com/charlie-owen-resume.pdf I have posted a mind map at https://retrosight.com/charlie-owen-mind-map.pdf which provides a conversational outline. I think the combination of the two will provide a well rounded view of what I offer and what I’m seeking.

The past 15 years have seen me be quite successful in the Technical Program Management discipline so a Principal or Lead role would be a nice fit. I'm also open to exploring outside the technology sector.

My ask of you:

1. I would love to chat with you over the phone, coffee or a meal in the next little while to talk about what’s happening in your world.

2. If you know of any immediate opportunities where you think I would be a great fit: Will you personally introduce me to the hiring team, manager or recruiter?

Thanks so much and I’m looking forward to connecting soon.

Cheers!

Charlie
