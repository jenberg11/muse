Dear < person >,

< custom intro >

Hi Lillian,

Recently my partner, Charlie Owen, attended a recruiting happy hour with your Zillow Offers teams. As we discussed his time at the event I became quite interested in how both the candidate and recruitment team experience could be improved in order to attract the absolute best talent.

I help teams and individuals increase productivity, foster creativity, improve communication, and pursue excellence in the following areas:

* Brainstorming
* Prototyping
* Experimenting
* Designing - Experiences and Events
* Communication - Verbal and Non-Verbal, Interpersonal, Written, Visual, Presentational

I'd like to get on a call with you and Charlie for one hour to discuss the possibilities further. What time next week works for you?

All the best,

Jen
