Dear < person >,

Hi! I'm Jen. I help teams and individuals increase productivity, foster creativity, improve communication, find happiness and pursue excellence by teaching them new ways of thinking, how to brainstorm, prototype, experiment, explore, iterate and convey ideas through written, verbal and demonstrative ways. How? Here are a few specific things I'm known for:

* Facilitation & experience design ninja.
* Leadership coach.
* Transition pathfinder & wrangler of chaos.
* Possibility provocateur.
* Illuminator of awesomeness.

I would love to talk with you about opportunities for my skills to bring value to your team, or even more broadly, your organization.

To schedule a 30-minute call to talk more about what's possible click here: https://calendly.com/jenberg/30min_phone_web

Or reply back and we can figure out what's next over email first.

And if you don't have any immediate need, all I ask is that you forward this note on to someone who might be looking to take things to the next level.

Thanks so much and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

All the best,
Jen
