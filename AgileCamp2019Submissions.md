##GUIDELINES & INFO

###THEME: "Business Agility - Platforms for Change"

Submissions should include a "connection" to the theme above and tailored to one of the following categories:
- Business Agility
- Agile Leadership and Culture
- Product Management and Strategy
- Innovation and Design
- Enterprise Agile Practices
- Technical Enablement

###SESSION GUIDELINES
Sessions will be approximately 50 minutes. We recommend that speakers share "real life" experiences, techniques, or other areas of specific knowledge in practicing Agility of all levels. Presentation materials are welcome as so are hands-on exercises or activities. Speaker "panels" are not ideal for this type of event and will not be accepted. 

Also, presenters are not to sell or "pitch" a product or a service. 

###REMUNERATION
Approved sessions will receive one complimentary entry to AgileCamp. That means that if there is more than a single speaker for a session, only one complimentary entry will be offered for that workshop. AgileCamp and its affiliates will not reimburse travel expenses for your attendance or other expenses to produce your session. 

At which AGILECAMP would you like to speak (pick one or many): *
Portland at Nike Headquarters in Beaverton, OR on September 20, 2019
San Francisco at Mission Bay Convention Center on December 6, 2019

###WORKSHOP DETAILS
####Name of Workshop (Title) *
The name of the proposed workshop session; preferably something relative to the conference theme. This is the "hook" that will attract attendees to the session while specific enough to articulate the nature of the workshop. Example: Use a title like “The Fundamentals of Scrum - How to Work in the 21st Century”, not “Great Ways of Working in the 21st Century”. Be specific and concise.

*Evolving Agility.*

####Summary (Elevator Pitch) *
A very brief (141 character) summary of the session topic. Think "elevator pitch". What will intrigue someone enough for them to say "I CANNOT miss this session!!". The audience for this section is the Attendee. Please proofread your entry because if you are selected, this summary will be published.

Walk away with quick activities to Skills to get you unstuck, help you communicate more powerfully, and brainstorm inclusively.

Description *
Describe the key points of your session in terms of content by providing more details. What will you be covering? What are the principles? What does the session outline look like? Are there exercises? What is the timing for each section of the workshop? Specific timelines are very helpful. The audience for this section is the Selection Committee.
