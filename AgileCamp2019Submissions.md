# GUIDELINES & INFO

## THEME: "Business Agility - Platforms for Change"
Submissions should include a "connection" to the theme above and tailored to one of the following categories:
- Business Agility
- Agile Leadership and Culture
- Product Management and Strategy
- Innovation and Design
- Enterprise Agile Practices
- Technical Enablement

## SESSION GUIDELINES
Sessions will be approximately 50 minutes. We recommend that speakers share "real life" experiences, techniques, or other areas of specific knowledge in practicing Agility of all levels. Presentation materials are welcome as so are hands-on exercises or activities. Speaker "panels" are not ideal for this type of event and will not be accepted. 

Also, presenters are not to sell or "pitch" a product or a service. 

## REMUNERATION
Approved sessions will receive one complimentary entry to AgileCamp. That means that if there is more than a single speaker for a session, only one complimentary entry will be offered for that workshop. AgileCamp and its affiliates will not reimburse travel expenses for your attendance or other expenses to produce your session. 

At which AGILECAMP would you like to speak (pick one or many): *

> Portland at Nike Headquarters in Beaverton, OR on September 20, 2019
>
> San Francisco at Mission Bay Convention Center on December 6, 2019 (??)

Hands-on activities that promote engagement are MANDATORY. Describe the activity and how it applies to the topic of your workshop.

> 30 Circles - An opening exercise to get things moving and help illuminate how simple assumptions can limit productivity.
>
> Emotional Check - Taken from Core Protocols, this simple activity is a quick way for a team to acknowledge each other and how our personal experience affects everything that we do - including our demeanor and how we engage with those around us in our professional world.
>
> Worlds Best/Worst Listener - How we engage with each other during conversations and meetings can make all the difference how we communicate, how we listen, what we hear, and ultimately how much gets done and how effectively. This activity illustrates very quickly how different ways we listen changes can change the game in an instint,. 
>
> 1-2-4-All - most often brainstorming sessions unintentionally set confident and extroverted voices and personalities up for success. This method of brainstorming does a nice job of leveling the playing fleid and creating an opportunity for more voices and ideas to be brought into the conversation.
