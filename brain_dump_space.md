Facilitation & experience design ninja.
Leadership coach.
Transition pathfinder & wrangler of chaos.
Possibility provocateur.
Illuminator of awesomeness.
Ice cream sandwich artisan.
Carousel connoisseur.
Sometimes circus monkey.
To pay the bills, I combine the first five on that list to work with teams and individuals to increase their productivity, creativity, communication, happiness, and pursuits of excellence. How? By teaching them new ways of thinking, listening, and engaging with each other around the things they do every day. Why? Because if we are awesome at working together within our teams that will extend beyond the walls of the company and naturally reach our customers and our communities.
