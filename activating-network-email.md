Subject: Looking for my next gig

Hello << person >>,

After the adventures of the last few years that included a professional sabbatical, an abundance of freelance work, and teaching in India, I'm feeling the pull to work again with a team.

To that end, I am activating my network to find the next great role and I am hoping to get your help!

My desire is to continue working with teams as they transform the way they engage with each other, their work, and their customers. This can look like culture transformation, large scale change readiness/management efforts, leadership and team development, or even design and implementation of learning and development programs. 

While I'm looking for that next role, I'm also available for freelance and project pased work

Along with my resume, I’ve attached a graphic mind-map of what I’m looking for. I think the combination of the two will provide a well-rounded view of what I’m bringing to the table and what I’m looking for.

Along with my resume at << HERE >> I have posted a mind map at << HERE >> which provides a conversational outline. I think the combination of the two will provide a well rounded view of what I offer and what I’m seeking.

My ask of you:

1. I would love to chat with you over the phone, coffee or a meal in the next little while to talk about what’s happening in your world.

2. If you know of any immediate opportunities where you think I would be a great fit: Will you personally introduce me to the hiring team, manager or recruiter?

Thanks so much and I’m looking forward to connecting soon.

Cheers!

Jen
