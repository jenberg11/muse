Subject: Looking for my next gig

Hello << person >>,

After the adventures of the last few years that included a professional sabbatical, an abundance of freelance work, and teaching in India, I'm feeling the pull to work again with a team.

To that end, I am activating my network to find the next great role and I am hoping to get your help!

My desire is to continue working with teams as they transform the way they engage with each other, their work, and their customers. This can look like change readiness/management initives, culture transformation, leadership and team development, or even design and implementation of learning and development programs.

While I'm looking for that next role, I'm also available for freelance and project pased work

I’ve attached my resume along with a graphic mind-map of what I’m looking for - I think the combination provides a well-rounded view of what I bring to the table and what I’m looking for.

My ask:

1. Can we connect over the phone, coffee/tea/adult beverage, or a meal in the next couple of weeks to talk about what’s happening in your world and opportunities you know of with your org.

2. Who else do I need to connect with and will you introduce me? This could be a hiring team, manager or recruiter, or someone awesome that could lead to more awesome being generated in the world.

Thanks so much and I’m looking forward to connecting soon.

Cheers!

Jen
