Subject: Looking for my next gig

Hello *<< person >>*,

After the adventures of the last few years that included a professional sabbatical, exploration of complex human systems, an abundance of freelance work, and teaching in India, it’s time for the next step in my professional pursuits. And to get back to working with a team – which I’ve missed deeply.

My desire is to continue working with teams as they transform the way they engage with each other, their work, and their customers. This can look like culture transformation, large scale change readiness/management efforts, leadership and team development, or even design and implementation of learning and development programs. 

Along with my resume, I’ve attached a graphic mind-map of what I’m looking for. I think the combination of the two will provide a well-rounded view of what I’m bringing to the table and what I’m looking for.

My ask of you is two-fold:

(1)	I would love to connect with you over coffee or lunch in the next week or two to talk more about what I’m looking for, what’s happening in your world, and what opportunities there might be with *<< their org >>*.
(2)	Who else do I need to connect with and will you introduce me?

Thanks so much and I’m looking forward to connecting soon.

Cheers!  
Jen
