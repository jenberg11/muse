Subject: Looking for my next gig

Hello << person >>,

After the adventures of the last few years that included a professional sabbatical, an abundance of freelance work, and teaching in India I'm feeling the pull to work again within a larger environment.

So I am activating my network to find the next great role and I am hoping to get your help!

Hallmarks of the thigs I enjoy working on and have particular strengths in: culture transformation, large scale change readiness / management efforts, leadership / team development and design + implementation of learning and development programs. In past positions I've been successul in people management, project management, user experience design (incuding prototyping) and consulting within the technology field.

While I'm looking for that next role, I'm also available for freelance and project based work

I’ve attached my resume along with a graphic mind-map of what I’m looking for - I think the combination provides a well-rounded view of what I bring to the table and what I’m seeking.

My ask:

1. Can we connect over the phone, coffee/tea/adult beverage, or a meal in the next couple of weeks to talk about what’s happening in your world and opportunities you know of with your org.

2. Who else do I need to connect with and will you introduce me? This could be a hiring team, manager or recruiter, or someone awesome that could lead to more awesome being generated in the world.

Thanks so much and I’m looking forward to connecting soon.

Cheers!

Jen

P.S. While I'm looking for that next role, I'm also available for freelance and project based work, primarily in team building and offsite facilitation.
